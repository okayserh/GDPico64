# BUS "Rebuild"
The BUS group was at the heart of the modular computer system. It provided a bus for 6 PCBs that usually included the CPU, some memory cards and some IO respectively Graphics cards.

Since the original PCBs are "unobtainium", I've spend an evening redesigning the original BUS backplane. I've made a few minor modifications to the original layout.

# Licensing

The hardware design itself, including schematic and PCB layout design files are licensed under the strongly-reciprocal variant of [CERN Open Hardware Licence version 2](license-cern_ohl_s_v2.txt).
